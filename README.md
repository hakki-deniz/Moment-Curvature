# Moment-Curvature
Moment curvature calculation for a single section

This piece of code is prepared as an answer for the question at:
        https://portwooddigital.com/2022/01/16/two-fibers-five-ways/


    There are three parts of the code:
        1 - Create a function to calculate moment_curvature
        2 - Build the model and analyze it
        3 - Visualize the result
